**Brief**

A set of [automated test scenarios](../tests/features/user_profile_creation_visitor_smoke.feature) have been created to verify the functionality of "[User Profile Creation](https://qa-assessment.pages.dev/)" page, based on the provided user story.

All tests are written in the Gherkin language, BDD style, which results in a human readable format.

The user story described:

- The complete set of fields expected to be featured on the form.
- The validation requirements associated with each individual field.
  - The need for accurate error handling.
- The distinction between mandatory and optional fields.

Assumptions during testing:

- Any excess fields other than described in the story would be considered a bug.
- Fields should have labels matching those in the story.
- Field labels should not have typos.
- Strictness of validation: always matching the examples given.
- The value of the two password fields shall match.
- Date of birth shall be in the past.
- The page and the form design to be responsive, and fully functional on smaller devices as well.

_All assumptions must be aligned on with the product owner, and tests shall be amended before final sign-off!_

# Results

**The implementation did not pass quality control.**

*Failing scenarios:*

- Correct form fields are displayed
- Relevant and typo free form field labels are displayed

# UAT & Recommendations

- The use of browser alert messages (in this implementation for indicating validation errors on form submit) is outdated. It may be foreign to a younger audience. It may be suppressed by extensions, which would result in loss of functionality. In-line, visual validation indicators recommended.
- For gender selection a drop-down would be more economical.
